## ⚙️ Configuration

The settings app provides an intuitive interface to configure:

- **🤖 AI Model**: Choose between different Whisper models (base, small, medium, large, turbo)
- **💻 Compute Engine**: Select GPU (CUDA) or CPU processing
- **🌐 Server Port**: Configure the port for the transcription server
- **🎤 Microphone**: Select your preferred audio input device
- **🔐 Authentication**: Optional security features
- **☁️ OpenAI Fallback**: API key for cloud processing when needed

Configuration is automatically saved to `webtalk_config.json` and applied in real-time.

## 🔧 Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Python**: 3.8+ (automatically installed via `install.bat`)
- **Browser**: Chrome/Chromium
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)
- **Storage**: ~2-4GB for models and dependencies

## 💡 Tips

- **First Run**: The first transcription may take longer as models are downloaded
- **GPU vs CPU**: GPU processing is 5-10x faster but requires CUDA setup
- **Model Selection**: Start with "base" model for good balance of speed/accuracy
- **Microphone**: Ensure Chrome has microphone permissions enabled

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"Python is not installed or not in PATH"**
- Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- ⚠️ **AVOID**: Microsoft Store Python (use python.org version)

**"Failed to create virtual environment"**
- Make sure you have the full Python installation (not Microsoft Store version)
- Try running Command Prompt as Administrator
- Update Python to the latest version

**PyWebView Installation Fails**
- Install Visual C++ Redistributable: [Download here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- Install WebView2 Runtime: [Download here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- Restart your computer after installing these

**PyTorch CUDA Installation Fails**
- This is normal if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU
- The installer will automatically fall back to CPU version
- CPU version works fine, just slower for large audio files

### Runtime Issues

**Settings App Won't Open**
- Install WebView2 Runtime: [Download here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- Check Windows Defender isn't blocking the application
- Try running `Launch.bat` as Administrator

**Chrome Extension Can't Connect**
- Make sure both server and settings app are running (`Launch.bat`)
- Check that Windows Firewall isn't blocking localhost connections
- Try disabling other extensions that might interfere
- Restart Chrome after installing the extension

**"No module named 'torch'" Error**
- Activate the virtual environment: `whisper_env\Scripts\activate.bat`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try running the installer again

**Microphone Not Working**
- Check microphone permissions in Windows Settings
- Ensure microphone is working in other applications
- Try a different microphone or USB headset

**Slow Transcription**
- Use a smaller Whisper model in settings (tiny, base instead of large)
- Consider upgrading RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- For faster processing, use a computer with NVIDIA GPU

### Performance Tips

**For Better Speed:**
- Use GPU if available (NVIDIA graphics card)
- Use smaller models (tiny, base) for faster transcription
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Use shorter audio clips

**For Better Accuracy:**
- Use larger models (medium, large) for better quality
- Ensure good microphone quality
- Record in quiet environment
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
