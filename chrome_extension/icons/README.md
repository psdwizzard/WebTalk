# WebTalk Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the toolbar
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:

1. Be square (same width and height)
2. Have a transparent background
3. Use the microphone ðŸŽ¤ theme to match the extension
4. Be saved as PNG files

## Placeholder Icons

If you don't have custom icons ready, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders:
- Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images
- Use a purple/blue gradient to match the extension theme
- Add a simple microphone symbol or text

The extension will work without these icons, but they provide a better user experience.
